            Butterfly identification is considered as a science as well as an art. A
            butterfly is like a painting where evolution has left its own unique
            signature and impression, like a painter upon his creations. Each
            species differs from each other by many factors such as size,
            pattern, colour, shape, flying pattern and difference in different
            body parts such as genitalia. In field one need to rely mostly on
            external characters to identify the species. But before that a person
            should know about its different body parts.

            The body of a butterfly is clearly divided into three following region.
            <h2>Head</h2>
            Head: Head or the cephalic region of a butterfly consists of major sensory organs such as a
pair of antenna and a pair of compound eyes. Antennae have a club-shaped structure towards
its distal end. In case of Skippers, a hook-shape structure called apiculus is present beyond
the club. Apart from them there is presence of a proboscis, a long hollow structure, through
which a butterfly takes nectar and tree or fruit sap etc. The proboscis is coiled like a clock
spring and covered by labial palps.
            <h2>Body</h2>
            Body: This is also called as thoracic region or thorax and comprises two pairs of wings,
three pairs of legs and many more internal structures associated with physiology. Basically,
19
butterfly wings are two layers of thin rigid membranes supported by strong veins which
provide physical support during the flight. The wings are covered by tiny, multiform multicoloured scales which determine different pattern and colouration of butterfly wings. The
legs of butterfly are slender and with sensory bristles.
            <h2>Abdomen</h2>
            Abdomen: This is the last cylindrical, long and segmented body part containing all major
internal organs. The abdomen has 10 segments but however only seven or eight segments
are visible externally

        <br>
            butterfly identification following things are of great importance:</br>
            * Colouration and pattern on wings.</br>
            * Colouration of the head, eye, body and abdomen.</br>
            * Venation of wings.</br>
            * Colouration of cilia.</br>
            * Length, shape and colour of the antennae.
